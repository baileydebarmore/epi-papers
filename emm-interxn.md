# Effect measure modification, interactions, and subgroups

## STROBE Guidelines 
"A third area of debate is how joint effects and interactions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive or 
multiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by the statistical model that fits best (see also item 12b and Box 8)? 
A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of each exposure as well as the joint effect—if possible in a table, as in 
the first example above [183], or in the study by Martinelli et al. [185]. Such a table gives the reader sufficient information to 
evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in Box 8). Confidence intervals 
for separate and joint effects may help the reader to judge the strength of the data. In addition, confidence intervals around measures 
of interaction, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of interaction or homogeneity tests. One 
recurrent problem is that authors use comparisons of P-values across subgroups, which lead to erroneous claims about an effect modifier. 
For instance, a statistically significant association in one category (e.g., men), but not in the other (e.g., women) does not in itself 
provide evidence of effect modification. Similarly, the confidence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inappropriately used to
infer that there is no interaction when intervals overlap. A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude 
of an association differs across subgroups."

Box 8 referenced above discusses biologic interaction (additive) versus statistical interaction (multiplicative) and resources
for presenting interaction results, including the  HuGENet proposed lay-out for transparent presentation.
