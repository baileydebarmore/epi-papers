**Reviewer comment:** Table 1 - can you list P values, so we can see if there are differences between the two groups please? 
<p>
  
**Author response:** Differences of opinion exist regarding performing significance tests of
baseline differences and reporting of the associated p-values in the table of baseline characteristics
(the classic Table 1). We left them out to comply with the CONSORT reporting checklist and elaboration paper (Moher et al 2010).
The recommendation from the CONSORT checklist and elaboration paper is not to report p-values in the baseline table.
Rather, it is recommendd that comparisons at baseline is based on the conwideration of the prognostic strength of variables 
measured and the size of any chance imbalances
that have occurred.

### Explanation from Leslie Farland (@L_Farland)

<p>
"The purpose of Table 1 is to describe the demographic makeup of the [study population] with and without our exposure. Our concern is that given sample size, 
unimportant correlations may appear statistically significant but without biologic relevance. 
Therefore, we respectfully request to omit p-values from Table 1 since we fear it would distract readers
from the overall purpose of the analysis. All covariates listed in Table 1 were *a priori* listed as potential confounding factors.\

**Great paper by Leslie to reference** - includes examples when a "significant" p-value shows no meaningful differences and vice versa.

"[It is] (s)ometimes useful to cite STROBE guidelines. I have had may editor / reviewer omments
that contradict STROBE made by journals that endorse STROBE. Asking for -values in Table 1 is the most common offedner...
pointing that out to editors has worked."

In the explanation for guideline 14a Give characteristics of study participants (e.g., demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders:
"Inferential measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals should not be used to describe the variability of characteristics, and **significance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables.** Also, P values are not an appropriate criterion for selecting which confounders to adjust for in analysis; even small differences in a confounder that has a strong effect on the outcome can be important [144,145]."

### Greenland et al 2016 Commentary on P-values, Confidence Intervals, and Power
Objectives of paper -  "explain the meaning of significance tests, confidence intervals, statistical power", "review 25 common misconceptions in light of explanations", discuss additional problems "explaining why it is important to examine and synthesize all results relating to a scientific question rather than focus on individual findings"

Great primer on statistical tests (history of and current practice)
Explanation of misconceptions points out that statements are "not only fallacious but also not true enough for practical purposes" getting at the idea that many of these statistical practices are continued in the literature because it's common

Select quotes:
"The general definition of a P value may help one to understand why statistical tests tell us much less than what many think they do: Not only does a P value not tell us whether the hypothesis targeted for testing is true or not; it says nothing specifically related to that hypothesis unless we can be completely assured that every other assumption used for its computation is correct—an assurance that is lacking in far too many studies."

"Too often, however, the P value is degraded into a dichotomy in which results are declared “statistically significant” if P falls on or below a cut-off (usually 0.05) and declared “nonsignificant” otherwise. The terms “significance level” and “alpha level” (α) are often used to refer to the cut-off; however, the term “significance level” invites confusion of the cut-off with the P value itself. Their difference is profound: the cut-off value α is supposed to be fixed in advance and is thus part of the study design, unchanged in light of the data. In contrast, the P value is a number computed from the data and thus an analysis result, unknown until it is computed."

"Much distortion arises from basic misunderstanding of what P values and their relatives (such as confidence intervals) do not tell us. Therefore, based on the articles in our reference list, we review prevalent P value misinterpretations as a way of moving toward defensible interpretations and presentations."

"**Statistical significance indicates a scientifically or substantively important relation has been detected.** No! Especially when a study is large, very minor effects or small assumption violations can lead to statistically significant tests of the null hypothesis. Again, a small null P value simply flags the data as being unusual if all the assumptions used to compute it (including the null hypothesis) were correct; but the way the data are unusual might be of no clinical interest. One must look at the confidence interval to determine which effect sizes of scientific or other substantive (e.g., clinical) importance are relatively compatible with the data, given the model."
