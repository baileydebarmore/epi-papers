# P-values

## Request for p-values in demographic tables


### Example from Thomas Bandholm (@TBandholm) - free to use
<p>

**Reviewer comment:** Table 1 - can you list P values, so we can see if there are differences between the two groups please? 
<p>
  
**Author response:** Differences of opinion exist regarding performing significance tests of
baseline differences and reporting of the associated p-values in the table of baseline characteristics
(the classic Table 1). We left them out to comply with the CONSORT reporting checklist and elaboration paper (Moher et al 2010).
The recommendation from the CONSORT checklist and elaboration paper is not to report p-values in the baseline table.
Rather, it is recommendd that comparisons at baseline is based on the conwideration of the prognostic strength of variables 
measured and the size of any chance imbalances
that have occurred.

### Explanation from Leslie Farland (@L_Farland)
<p>
"The purpose of Table 1 is to describe the demographic makeup of the [study population] with and without our exposure. Our concern is that given sample size, 
unimportant correlations may appear statistically significant but without biologic relevance. 
Therefore, we respectfully request to omit p-values from Table 1 since we fear it would distract readers
from the overall purpose of the analysis. All covariates listed in Table 1 were *a priori* listed as potential confounding factors.\

**Great paper by Leslie to reference** - includes examples when a "significant" p-value shows no meaningful differences and vice versa.

"[It is] (s)ometimes useful to cite STROBE guidelines. I have had may editor / reviewer omments
that contradict STROBE made by journals that endorse STROBE. Asking for -values in Table 1 is the most common offedner...
pointing that out to editors has worked."
